## GUI Interaction 
_Downloading ADS-B Data_: 
Assumptions: 
- what we start with, what we get


_Processing ADS-B Data_:
- go through fields

- 



Custom Regions:

## Outputs
- grpahs
- maps saved

## Next Steps
Assumptions: 
- will kill zeros
- note precentages for the graphs are only of the bins given .
- note map saving
- note can work for any OS
- Things that can be changed manually:
-   - note grid is preset but can be changed manually
-   - saving data frame with final data
 
To work on: 
- r2 and getting from the website itself
- need to re-add and clean up cusotm polygons
