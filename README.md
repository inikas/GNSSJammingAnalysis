## Introduction to GNSS Jamming
Global Navigation Satellites Systems (GNSS), which the American Global Positioning System (GPS) is an example of, are used by private, commercial, and military users for accurate and precise location services. The signals emitted by GNSS satellite systems are used by both terrestrial and airbornes systems, such as aircraft. Notably, however, history was made on March 3, 2025 "when the [Lunar GNSS Receiver Experiment (LuGRE)](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/somd/space-communications-navigation-program/nasa-successfully-acquires-gps-signals-on-moon/#:~:text=NASA%20and%20the%20Italian%20Space,signals%20on%20the%20Moon's%20surface.) became the first technology demonstration to acquire and track Earth-based navigation signals on the Moon’s surface." GNSS signals are [used](https://www.gps.gov/applications/) by devices ranging from cell phones to shipping containers. Diruption of these capacilities to such assets could lead to significant inconvenience and economic loss. Disruption of GNSS signals to systems like commercial aircraft, however, [could aversly affect thier safety systems](https://www.csis.org/events/what-are-impacts-gps-jamming-and-spoofing-civilians), making routine flying more dangerous. 

As GNSS systems are space systems, attacks that disrupt or corrupt GNSS signals can be considered counterspace capabilities. Jamming, "an electronic attack that uses radio frequency signals to interfere with communications,"]()

## GUI Interaction 
_Downloading ADS-B Data_:

- zeros are killed
- what we start with, what we get
- - note delay may ocure if downloading to cloud folder


_Processing ADS-B Data_:
- go through fields

- 



Custom Regions:

## Outputs
- grpahs
- maps saved

## Next Steps
Assumptions: 
- will kill zeros
- note precentages for the graphs are only of the bins given .
- note map saving
- note can work for any OS
- Things that can be changed manually:
-   - note grid is preset but can be changed manually
-   - saving data frame with final data
 
To work on: 
- r2 and getting from the website itself
- need to re-add and clean up cusotm polygons
