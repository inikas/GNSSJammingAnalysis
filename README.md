## Introduction to GNSS Jamming
Global Navigation Satellites Systems (GNSS), which the Global Positions System (GPS) is an example of, are used by private, commercial, and military users for accurate and precise location services. The signals emitted by GNSS satellite systems are used by both terrestrial and airbornes systems, such as aircraft. Notably, history was made on March 3, 2025 when for the first time a Lunar asset acquired GPS signals ().

## GUI Interaction 
_Downloading ADS-B Data_: 

ss
- zeros are killed
- what we start with, what we get
- - note delay may ocure if downloading to cloud folder


_Processing ADS-B Data_:
- go through fields

- 



Custom Regions:

## Outputs
- grpahs
- maps saved

## Next Steps
Assumptions: 
- will kill zeros
- note precentages for the graphs are only of the bins given .
- note map saving
- note can work for any OS
- Things that can be changed manually:
-   - note grid is preset but can be changed manually
-   - saving data frame with final data
 
To work on: 
- r2 and getting from the website itself
- need to re-add and clean up cusotm polygons
